# Quizzie
## The next generation quiz and examination platform
### Hey there! Quizzie is a next generation, advanced quiz and examination platform. Here, the users (teachers, students) would not face any problem like excessive reloading time as the project is made using React JS on a single page layout. Quizzie platform also has an inbuilt terminal where the users can give commands to perform various actions. It would save the time of both, students and teachers. It would also have features like voice commands, inbuilt Question-Answer section where the students can discuss their doubts with the teacher. But, the doubts section cannot be accessed while the quiz is ongoing. The platform would also contain advanced plagiarism checking and machine learning algorithms to detect cases of cheating and inform the teacher. The platform contains various quiz modes like Normal mode, time bounded mode. The time bounded mode would allow dynamic scoring where the points for a question would decrease as students answer them. The first one to answer gets the maximum points and the last to answer gets the minimu points. Any cases of using Right clicks, shift, ctrl/cmd, tab, alt, keys ranging from F1 to F12, or any other actions like opening new tabs, taking screenshots would be considered as cheating. The platform would also take pictures of the students after frequent intervals.
